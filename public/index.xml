      <description>Dataset 1: Password Strength For this project, I am looking at a dataset that analyzes different passwords and their strengths. I got this data from TidyTuesday on Github. The passwords are grouped into 10 different categories. The data looks at how long each password took to crack and the unit of time associated with it. The data also looks at how long each password took to crack offline in seconds. The authors of the data also included the rank of the popularity of each password in their database.</description>

      <description>My name is Regan Yates. I am a Data Science student in my third year of college. I am creating this blog as part of a final for my Programming Languages class. I am hoping to continue to update this blog with future projects as I continue my college career. My concentration is in Social Data Analytics. I am also minoring in sociology. I have always thought that the way that people are and the reasons behind why they do what they do is so interesting.</description>
