My name is Regan Yates. I am a Data Science student in my third year of college. I am creating this blog as part of a final for my Programming Languages class. I am hoping to continue to update this blog with future projects as I continue my college career. My concentration is in Social Data Analytics. I am also minoring in sociology. I have always thought that the way that people are and the reasons behind why they do what they do is so interesting.
